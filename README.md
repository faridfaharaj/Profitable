## About
Profitable is a Minecraft Economy plugin that adds **real** supply and demand to the game using an exchange!

This means that prices arent pre-set, nor just go up +1 when someone buys something,
Prices are **placed by the players** by using orders, which transact whenever two orders agree on certain price range, and thus turning into the current value of the asset.

    #             -All bars are the same quality, therefore interchangeable (Fungible) v
    #             -Traded in large amounts (Traded in Bulk) v
    #             -Usually gathered from the ground (raw material) v
    #
    #       DIAMOND HELMET is NOT a commodity
    #             -Enchantments, damage, and trims make each one unique (Non-Fungible) x
    #             -Usually traded one at a time (not in bulk) x
    #             -Finished product (not raw) x
    #
    #     but this is only a recommendation anyway, use this plugin however you want.

# üìë Orders
This plugin uses **Orders** to trade.
Orders are instructions to sell or buy an asset (item, entity, currency, etc...) under specified conditions

## üìó Market Order

A **Market order** lets you transact immediately with the best available price in the order book.

## üìò Limit Order

**Limit Orders** lets you choose the price you want, but may not execute right away as it needs someone else to agree on your price, Players can place an order to trade stuff at the price they think fair, actually influencing the market.

## üìï Stop-Limit Order

A **Stop-Limit Order** becomes a **Limit Order** once the market reaches the specified trigger price

Useful if you think Prices will keep going up after a certain price

# Market Data & Analysis

Since Profitable is a plugin designed to simulate real trading, which includes speculation and market data tracking,
Players can monitor **prices**, **price movements**, **liquidity**, **supply**.

Even some nice fancy candle graphs, so players can predict and profit off of speculation.

![2025-04-20_20 30 33](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a7d318c-c17d-4f68-b403-386a3527d711)


# Why?

**Put it like this**, 

> Imagine you have a server where two groups of players start fighting, they start buying a lot of diamonds and netherite for gear so people start selling it a bit > more expensive every time because they have to go farther and farther to find them, so **prices start rising**.
> 
> now our friend **johnny** here, notices this and buys 100 diamonds with all his balance expecting prices to go even higher,
> 
> Sadly the leader of one of these groups gets banned a day later so they stop fighting, and now everyone has so many and the **price is so high** people don't want to buy anymore. 
> And those who do, **want it cheaper**, so every time someone sells a diamond, it transacts with a cheaper order, so **prices start to fall**.
> 
> johnny has now a bunch of useless diamonds and no money,
> however, if **prices had gone up** as he expected **he'd be rich**
 
Profitable makes this kind of scenarios possible, it lets everyone experience the actual depth of a real market. It's not just a store like many linear price adjustment systems that have led to **broken economies** due to farms and the rising number of raids, 
  
**Profitable** not only makes that add to the fun, but prices adjust **themselves**. 
Because you‚Äôre not just buying and selling; you‚Äôre participating in an **actual economy** where people and events are behind prices.

I hope with that I have convinced you to download this wonderful plugin, have a great day.
