# About
Profitable adds a quick and authentic way for players to buy and sell stuff on your server.
Although is designed to work alongside other economy plugins, it can totally work by its own as it uses its a separate **wallets** which supports **multiple currencies** and assets.

### Orders

This plugins uses **Orders** to trade.
Orders are instructions to sell or buy an asset (item, entity, currency, etc..) under specified conditions

For example:

- **Limit order** lets you choose prize, but may not execute right away

- **Market order** acts inmediatly at the lowest available prize

Profitable will find the best prices in the order book, filling your order with as many existing orders as needed or just adding it to the book if no match is found;
However, for you, it only takes a simple command.

By using a single:


``/sell <Asset> limit <units> <price>``

or 

``/buy <Asset> limit <units> <price>``


Players can place an order to trade stuff at the price they think fair, actually influencing the market.



### Market Data & Analysis

Since profitable its a plugin that simulates real trading, it includes speculation and market data tracking, wich of course you can do.

Players can monitor **prices**, **price movements**, **liquidity**, **supply**, and more stuff using:

``/asset peek <asset>``

Even some nice candle graphs.



# Compatibility

This plugin can work with vault, meaning its compatible with anything compatible with vault! (this can be configured too)

# Why?

**Put it like this**, 

Imagine you have a server where two groups of players start fighting, they start buying a lot of diamonds and netherite for gear so people start selling it a bit more expensive every time because they have to go farther and farther to find them, so **prices start rising**.

now our friend **jhonny** here, notices this and buys 100 diamonds with all his balance expecting prices to go even higher,

Sadly the leader of one of this groups gets banned a day later so they stop fighting, and now everyone has so many and the **price is so high** people dont wanna buy anymore. 
And those who do, **want it cheaper**, so every time someone sells a diamond, it transacts with a cheaper order, so **prices start to fall**.

jhonny has now a bunch of useless diamonds and no money,
however, if **prices had gone up** as he expected **he'd be rich**

Profitable makes this kind of scenarios possible, it lets everyone experience the actual depth of a real market. Its not just a store like many linear price adjustment systems that have led to **broken economies** because of farms and the rising number of raids, 
 
**Profitable** not only makes that add to the fun, but prices adjust **themselves**. 
Because you’re not just buying and selling; you’re participating in an **actual economy** where people and events are behind prices.
With this plugin You can outsmart other players, invest, predict trends, and see how real markets work by playing a game.


I hope with that i have convinced you to download this wonderful plugin, have a great day.
